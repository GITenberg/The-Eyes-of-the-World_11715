description: A young painter named Aaron King heads out west to California. There
  he meets and befriends Conrad Lagrange, a famous and critically renowned novelist
  who, by his own admission, writes "the putrid offal that self-respecting writers
  reject." Will Aaron flatter the rich and powerful men and women who control the
  art world, or keep his integrity as an artist? Meanwhile, he falls in love with
  a free-spirited girl named Sybil.
